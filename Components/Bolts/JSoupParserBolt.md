The [JSoupParserBolt](https://github.com/DigitalPebble/storm-crawler/blob/master/core/src/main/java/com/digitalpebble/stormcrawler/bolt/JSoupParserBolt.java) can be used to parse HTML documents and extract the outlinks, text and metadata it contains. If you want to parse non-HTML documents, use the [Tika-based ParserBolt](https://github.com/DigitalPebble/storm-crawler/tree/master/external/src/main/java/com/digitalpebble/storm/crawler/tika) from the external modules.

This parser calls the [[URLFilters]] and [[ParseFilters]] defined in the configuration. Please note that it calls [[MetadataTransfer]] prior to calling the [[ParseFilters]], if you create new Outlinks in your [[ParseFilters]] you'll need to make sure that you use MetadataTransfer there to inherit the Metadata from the parent document.

The **JSoupParserBolt** automatically identifies the charset of the documents. It uses the [status stream](statusStream) to report parsing errors but also for the outlinks it extracts from a page. These would typically be used by an extension of [AbstractStatusUpdaterBolt](https://github.com/DigitalPebble/storm-crawler/blob/master/core/src/main/java/com/digitalpebble/stormcrawler/persistence/AbstractStatusUpdaterBolt.java) and persisted in some form of storage.
