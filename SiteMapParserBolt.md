Storm-crawler can handle sitemap files thanks to the **SiteMapParserBolt**. This bolt should be placed before the standard **ParserBolt** in the topology, as illustrated in [CrawlTopology](https://github.com/DigitalPebble/storm-crawler/blob/29c03232031af298dc6435047e99e2cb2f11c5d6/src/main/java/com/digitalpebble/storm/crawler/CrawlTopology.java#L53).

The reason for this is that the **SiteMapParserBolt** acts as a filter: it passes on any incoming tuples to the default stream so that it gets processed by the **ParserBolt**, unless the tuple contains `isSitemap=true` in its metadata, in which case the **SiteMapParserBolt** will parse it itself. Any outlinks found in the sitemap files are then emitted on the [[statusStream]].
